"Bruce Hornsby performs solo on the Anderson Center last weekend. Hornsby’s commercial stock soared early on when “The Way It Is” became the most-played song on American radio in 1987, winning ASCAP’s Song of the Year award. Subsequent hits such as “Mandolin Rain” and “Every Little Kiss” established Hornsby as a popular pop act, while high-profile work with the likes of Don Henley and Huey Lewis made him an in-demand collaborator. He performed over 100 concerts with the Grateful Dead and his eclectic musical interests have led him into jazz, classical, bluegrass and even electronica.
